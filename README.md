# ESX Gunshop (from vRP GunShop)

Hello everyone, I am releasing an updated gun shop for [ESX](https://esx-org.github.io/) which is fully customizable!

Features:
* Fully customizable with a config file
* Works perfectly with OneSync & OneSync Infinity
* Everything you need for a Gunshop
* You can make it so only certain groups can buy weapons

Notes:
* This is from the vRP Version : https://github.com/bxrksggs/vrp_gunshop.
* You can make/edit where the Gunshops are located within the `cfg/config.lua` file.

How to install:
1. Ensure you have the RageUI resource started before the menu.
2. Download the forked version of [RageUI](https://github.com/bxrksggs/RageUI).
3. Download my repo of the gun shop [here](https://github.com/naytoxp/esx_gunshop).
4. Copy esx_gunshop into your resources folder.
5. Copy RageUI into your resources folder.
6. Start your two resources & have fun!
